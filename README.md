WELCOME TO ASTEROIDS!

You are a lone space-traveller, tasked with cleansing the cosmos of the evil aliens: the Jrbaxers. With enemies in and asteroids blocking your path, can you, armed with only your laser gun on your spaceship, survive to defeat Jrbatu, the Jrbaxer overlord?

## How To Play
To move the player *(the spaceship)*,  
use **W, A, S, D** keys to move.

Press **Space** to shoot a laser.  
The amount of lasers you can have onscreen depends on the difficulty.  
**5** on easy  
**3** on classic  
**2** on hard and very hard

You have **3** *(5 if on easy and hard)* health at the beginning . If an asteroid, an enemy, or one of their red lasers hits you, you will lose 1 health. On very hard, you only have **1** health.
If you reach 0 health, the game's over!

Your health regenerates every **7 seconds** in classic or **4 seconds** in easy.  
Health regeneration is disabled on hard and very hard.

Other factors that can be changed by difficulty includes  
- The spawn rate of the asteroids and aliens
- Score multiplier

Press **ESC** to quit at any time.
