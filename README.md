WELCOME TO ASTEROIDS!

You are a lone space-traveller, tasked with cleansing the cosmos of the evil aliens: the Jrbaxers. With enemies in and asteroids blocking your path, can you, armed with only your laser gun on your spaceship, survive to defeat Jrbatu, the Jrbaxer overlord?

## How To Play
To move the player *(the spaceship)*,  
use **W, A, S, D** keys to move

Press **Space** to shoot a laser.  
You can only have 3 lasers on screen at a time.

You have **3** health at the beginning. If an asteroid, an enemy, or one of their red lasers hits you, you will lose 1 health.  
If you reach 0 health, the game's over!

You regenerate 1 health every 7 seconds by default. This can be changed by changing the variable in  
```
self.regeneration_rate = 7
```
This is the recommended method of changing the difficulty
