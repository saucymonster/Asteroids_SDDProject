WELCOME TO ASTEROIDS!

You are a lone space-traveller, tasked with cleansing the cosmos of the evil aliens: the Jrbaxers. With enemies in and asteroids blocking your path, can you, armed with only your laser gun on your spaceship, survive to defeat Jrbatu, the Jrbaxer overlord?

USER GUIDE:
Use WASD to move your character.
Press space to shoot a laser. You can only have 3 lasers on screen at a time.

If an asteroid, an enemy, or one of their red lasers hits you, they subtract 1 health from you. If you reach 0 health, you die and lose the game! 

You regenerate 1 health every 7 seconds. This can be changed by going into main.py and adjusting the self.regeneration_rate variable, which you can do to adjust the difficulty!
